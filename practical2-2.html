In 1972 he introduced the first polo shirt with the famous logo of a man on horseback. He designed the iconic outfits for the 1974 film “The Great Gatsby” and dressed the US Olympic team in 2008.

          <p class="text">Dolce & Gabbana is an Italian luxury fashion brand founded in 1985 by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. The duo met in Milan in the early 1980s while working as assistants in an atelier. They quickly became friends and started designing their own collection, which they presented at Milan Fashion Week in 1985. The collection was a huge success, and they were immediately recognized as rising stars in the fashion industry. 

            Dolce & Gabbana is known for its glamorous and sensual designs that draw inspiration from the duo’s Southern Italian roots.

            <h1>BURBERRY</h1>
          </div>

         

          <p class="text">Burberry is a British luxury fashion brand founded in 1856 by Thomas Burberry. Known for its signature trench coats, the brand has become a global symbol of British elegance and sophistication. The iconic check pattern, which has become synonymous with the brand, was first introduced as a lining for Burberry’s trench coats in the 1920s. 

            In recent years, Burberry has undergone a transformation, thanks in part to the appointment of Riccardo Tisci as chief creative officer in 2018. Tisci has brought a fresh perspective to the brand, introducing new styles and designs while still paying homage to its heritage. In 2022, Daniel Lee was announced as the new creative director, and it will be interesting to see where he takes the brand next.  </p>
